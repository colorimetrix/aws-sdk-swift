/**
You can use the ACM PCA API to create a private certificate authority (CA). You must first call the CreateCertificateAuthority operation. If successful, the operation returns an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your private CA. Use this ARN as input to the GetCertificateAuthorityCsr operation to retrieve the certificate signing request (CSR) for your private CA certificate. Sign the CSR using the root or an intermediate CA in your on-premises PKI hierarchy, and call the ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate to import your signed private CA certificate into ACM PCA.  Use your private CA to issue and revoke certificates. These are private certificates that identify and secure client computers, servers, applications, services, devices, and users over SSLS/TLS connections within your organization. Call the IssueCertificate operation to issue a certificate. Call the RevokeCertificate operation to revoke a certificate.   Certificates issued by your private CA can be trusted only within your organization, not publicly.  Your private CA can optionally create a certificate revocation list (CRL) to track the certificates you revoke. To create a CRL, you must specify a RevocationConfiguration object when you call the CreateCertificateAuthority operation. ACM PCA writes the CRL to an S3 bucket that you specify. You must specify a bucket policy that grants ACM PCA write permission.  You can also call the CreateCertificateAuthorityAuditReport to create an optional audit report that lists every time the CA private key is used. The private key is used for signing when the IssueCertificate or RevokeCertificate operation is called.

The CA configuration specifies the name of the algorithm and key size to be used to create the CA private key, the type of signing algorithm that the CA uses to sign, and X.500 subject information. The CRL (certificate revocation list) configuration specifies the CRL expiration period in days (the validity period of the CRL), the Amazon S3 bucket that will contain the CRL, and a CNAME alias for the S3 bucket that is included in certificates issued by the CA.

Call the UpdateCertificateAuthority operation and set the CertificateAuthorityStatus parameter to DISABLED.  Additionally, you can delete a CA if you are waiting for it to be created (the Status field of the CertificateAuthority is CREATING). You can also delete it if the CA has been created but you haven't yet imported the signed certificate (the Status is PENDING_CERTIFICATE) into ACM PCA.  If the CA is in one of the aforementioned states and you call DeleteCertificateAuthority, the CA's status changes to DELETED. However, the CA won't be permentantly deleted until the restoration period has passed. By default, if you do not set the PermanentDeletionTimeInDays parameter, the CA remains restorable for 30 days. You can set the parameter from 7 to 30 days. The DescribeCertificateAuthority operation returns the time remaining in the restoration window of a Private CA in the DELETED state.
