/**
With Application Auto Scaling, you can configure automatic scaling for your scalable resources. You can use Application Auto Scaling to accomplish the following tasks:   Define scaling policies to automatically scale your AWS or custom resources   Scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms   Schedule one-time or recurring scaling actions   View the history of your scaling events   Application Auto Scaling can scale the following resources:   Amazon ECS services. For more information, see Service Auto Scaling in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.   Amazon EC2 Spot fleets. For more information, see Automatic Scaling for Spot Fleet in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.   Amazon EMR clusters. For more information, see Using Automatic Scaling in Amazon EMR in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.   AppStream 2.0 fleets. For more information, see Fleet Auto Scaling for Amazon AppStream 2.0 in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Developer Guide.   Provisioned read and write capacity for Amazon DynamoDB tables and global secondary indexes. For more information, see Managing Throughput Capacity Automatically with DynamoDB Auto Scaling in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.   Amazon Aurora Replicas. For more information, see Using Amazon Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas.   Amazon SageMaker endpoint variants. For more information, see Automatically Scaling Amazon SageMaker Models.   Custom resources provided by your own applications or services. More information is available in our GitHub repository.    To learn more about Application Auto Scaling, see the Application Auto Scaling User Guide. To configure automatic scaling for multiple resources across multiple services, use AWS Auto Scaling to create a scaling plan for your application. For more information, see the AWS Auto Scaling User Guide.
