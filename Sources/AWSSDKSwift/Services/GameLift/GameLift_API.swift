/**
Amazon GameLift Service  Amazon GameLift is a managed service for developers who need a scalable, dedicated server solution for their multiplayer games. Use Amazon GameLift for these tasks: (1) set up computing resources and deploy your game servers, (2) run game sessions and get players into games, (3) automatically scale your resources to meet player demand and manage costs, and (4) track in-depth metrics on game server performance and player usage. The Amazon GameLift service API includes two important function sets:    Manage game sessions and player access -- Retrieve information on available game sessions; create new game sessions; send player requests to join a game session.    Configure and manage game server resources -- Manage builds, fleets, queues, and aliases; set auto-scaling policies; retrieve logs and metrics.   This reference guide describes the low-level service API for Amazon GameLift. You can use the API functionality with these tools:    The Amazon Web Services software development kit (AWS SDK) is available in multiple languages including C++ and C#. Use the SDK to access the API programmatically from an application, such as a game client.   The AWS command-line interface (CLI) tool is primarily useful for handling administrative actions, such as setting up and managing Amazon GameLift settings and resources. You can use the AWS CLI to manage all of your AWS services.   The AWS Management Console for Amazon GameLift provides a web interface to manage your Amazon GameLift settings and resources. The console includes a dashboard for tracking key resources, including builds and fleets, and displays usage and performance metrics for your games as customizable graphs.   Amazon GameLift Local is a tool for testing your game's integration with Amazon GameLift before deploying it on the service. This tools supports a subset of key API actions, which can be called from either the AWS CLI or programmatically. See Testing an Integration.

    ///  Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.  When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error. To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status PLACING, where a new game session is created for the match.  If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where all players accepted the match, the ticket status is returned to SEARCHING to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to accept the match, the ticket status is set to FAILED, and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed.

    ///  Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. By using a fleet alias instead of a specific fleet ID, you can switch gameplay and players to a new fleet without changing your game client or other game components. For example, for games in production, using an alias allows you to seamlessly redirect your player base to a new game server update.  Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site.  To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID, which you can reference when creating a game session. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling UpdateAlias. Alias-related operations include:    CreateAlias     ListAliases     DescribeAlias     UpdateAlias     DeleteAlias     ResolveAlias

    ///  Creates a new Amazon GameLift build record for your game server binary files and points to the location of your game server build files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) location.  Game server binaries must be combined into a .zip file for use with Amazon GameLift. See Uploading Your Game for more information.   To create new builds quickly and easily, use the AWS CLI command  upload-build . This helper command uploads your build and creates a new build record in one step, and automatically handles the necessary permissions. See  Upload Build Files to Amazon GameLift for more help.  The CreateBuild operation should be used only when you need to manually upload your build files, as in the following scenarios:   Store a build file in an Amazon S3 bucket under your own AWS account. To use this option, you must first give Amazon GameLift access to that Amazon S3 bucket. See  Create a Build with Files in Amazon S3 for detailed help. To create a new build record using files in your Amazon S3 bucket, call CreateBuild and specify a build name, operating system, and the storage location of your game build.   Upload a build file directly to Amazon GameLift's Amazon S3 account. To use this option, you first call CreateBuild with a build name and operating system. This action creates a new build record and returns an Amazon S3 storage location (bucket and key only) and temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload your build file to the storage location (see the Amazon S3 topic Uploading Objects). You can upload files to a location only once.    If successful, this operation creates a new build record with a unique build ID and places it in INITIALIZED status. You can use DescribeBuild to check the status of your build. A build must be in READY status before it can be used to create fleets. Build-related operations include:    CreateBuild     ListBuilds     DescribeBuild     UpdateBuild     DeleteBuild

    ///  Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. A fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of which can run multiple server processes to host game sessions. You set up a fleet to use instances with certain hardware specifications (see Amazon EC2 Instance Types for more information), and deploy your game build to run on each instance.  To create a new fleet, you must specify the following: (1) a fleet name, (2) the build ID of a successfully uploaded game build, (3) an EC2 instance type, and (4) a run-time configuration, which describes the server processes to run on each instance in the fleet. If you don't specify a fleet type (on-demand or spot), the new fleet uses on-demand instances by default. You can also configure the new fleet with the following settings:   Fleet description   Access permissions for inbound traffic   Fleet-wide game session protection   Resource usage limits     VPC peering connection (see VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets)   If you use Amazon CloudWatch for metrics, you can add the new fleet to a metric group. By adding multiple fleets to a metric group, you can view aggregated metrics for all the fleets in the group.  If the CreateFleet call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the following tasks. You can track the process of a fleet by checking the fleet status or by monitoring fleet creation events:   Creates a fleet record. Status: NEW.   Begins writing events to the fleet event log, which can be accessed in the Amazon GameLift console. Sets the fleet's target capacity to 1 (desired instances), which triggers Amazon GameLift to start one new EC2 instance.   Downloads the game build to the new instance and installs it. Statuses: DOWNLOADING, VALIDATING, BUILDING.    Starts launching server processes on the instance. If the fleet is configured to run multiple server processes per instance, Amazon GameLift staggers each launch by a few seconds. Status: ACTIVATING.   Sets the fleet's status to ACTIVE as soon as one server process is ready to host a game session.   Fleet-related operations include:    CreateFleet     ListFleets     DeleteFleet    Describe fleets:    DescribeFleetAttributes     DescribeFleetCapacity     DescribeFleetPortSettings     DescribeFleetUtilization     DescribeRuntimeConfiguration     DescribeEC2InstanceLimits     DescribeFleetEvents      Update fleets:    UpdateFleetAttributes     UpdateFleetCapacity     UpdateFleetPortSettings     UpdateRuntimeConfiguration      Manage fleet actions:    StartFleetActions     StopFleetActions

    ///  Creates a multiplayer game session for players. This action creates a game session record and assigns an available server process in the specified fleet to host the game session. A fleet must have an ACTIVE status before a game session can be created in it. To create a game session, specify either fleet ID or alias ID and indicate a maximum number of players to allow in the game session. You can also provide a name and game-specific properties for this game session. If successful, a GameSession object is returned containing the game session properties and other settings you specified.  Idempotency tokens. You can add a token that uniquely identifies game session requests. This is useful for ensuring that game session requests are idempotent. Multiple requests with the same idempotency token are processed only once; subsequent requests return the original result. All response values are the same with the exception of game session status, which may change.  Resource creation limits. If you are creating a game session on a fleet with a resource creation limit policy in force, then you must specify a creator ID. Without this ID, Amazon GameLift has no way to evaluate the policy for this new game session request.  Player acceptance policy. By default, newly created game sessions are open to new players. You can restrict new player access by using UpdateGameSession to change the game session's player session creation policy.  Game session logs. Logs are retained for all active game sessions for 14 days. To access the logs, call GetGameSessionLogUrl to download the log files.  Available in Amazon GameLift Local.

    ///  Establishes a new queue for processing requests to place new game sessions. A queue identifies where new game sessions can be hosted -- by specifying a list of destinations (fleets or aliases) -- and how long requests can wait in the queue before timing out. You can set up a queue to try to place game sessions on fleets in multiple regions. To add placement requests to a queue, call StartGameSessionPlacement and reference the queue name.  Destination order. When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift tries each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host the new game session. A queue's default order is determined by how destinations are listed. The default order is overridden when a game session placement request provides player latency information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the best possible gameplay experience.  Player latency policies. For placement requests containing player latency information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for example, you might set a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher cap for the next 60 seconds, etc.  To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of destinations and, if desired, a set of latency policies. If successful, a new queue object is returned. Queue-related operations include:    CreateGameSessionQueue     DescribeGameSessionQueues     UpdateGameSessionQueue     DeleteGameSessionQueue

    ///  Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. A matchmaking configuration sets out guidelines for matching players and getting the matches into games. You can set up multiple matchmaking configurations to handle the scenarios needed for your game. Each matchmaking ticket (StartMatchmaking or StartMatchBackfill) specifies a configuration for the match and provides player attributes to support the configuration being used.  To create a matchmaking configuration, at a minimum you must specify the following: configuration name; a rule set that governs how to evaluate players and find acceptable matches; a game session queue to use when placing a new game session for the match; and the maximum time allowed for a matchmaking attempt.  Player acceptance -- In each configuration, you have the option to require that all players accept participation in a proposed match. To enable this feature, set AcceptanceRequired to true and specify a time limit for player acceptance. Players have the option to accept or reject a proposed match, and a match does not move ahead to game session placement unless all matched players accept.   Matchmaking status notification -- There are two ways to track the progress of matchmaking tickets: (1) polling ticket status with DescribeMatchmaking; or (2) receiving notifications with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). To use notifications, you first need to set up an SNS topic to receive the notifications, and provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration (see  Setting up Notifications for Matchmaking). Since notifications promise only "best effort" delivery, we recommend calling DescribeMatchmaking if no notifications are received within 30 seconds.

A rule set describes the type of match to create, such as the number and size of teams, and sets the parameters for acceptable player matches, such as minimum skill level or character type. Rule sets are used in matchmaking configurations, which define how matchmaking requests are handled. Each MatchmakingConfiguration uses one rule set; you can set up multiple rule sets to handle the scenarios that suit your game (such as for different game modes), and create a separate matchmaking configuration for each rule set. See additional information on rule set content in the MatchmakingRuleSet structure. For help creating rule sets, including useful examples, see the topic  Adding FlexMatch to Your Game. Once created, matchmaking rule sets cannot be changed or deleted, so we recommend checking the rule set syntax using ValidateMatchmakingRuleSet before creating the rule set. To create a matchmaking rule set, provide the set of rules and a unique name. Rule sets must be defined in the same region as the matchmaking configuration they will be used with. Rule sets cannot be edited or deleted. If you need to change a rule set, create a new one with the necessary edits and then update matchmaking configurations to use the new rule set.

    ///  Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling.  Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences. You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling StopFleetActions with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call StartFleetActions with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with DeleteScalingPolicy. Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling.  Target-based policy  A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target.  For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer.  To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a TargetConfiguration object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.  Rule-based policy  A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action.  For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%." A policy's rule statement has the following structure: If [MetricName] is [ComparisonOperator] [Threshold] for [EvaluationPeriods] minutes, then [ScalingAdjustmentType] to/by [ScalingAdjustment]. To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this: If [PercentIdleInstances] is [GreaterThanThreshold] [20] for [15] minutes, then [PercentChangeInCapacity] to/by [10]. To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

This value is set when requesting a new game session with CreateGameSession or updating with UpdateGameSession. Game session names do not need to be unique to a game session.    gameSessionProperties -- Custom data defined in a game session's GameProperty parameter. GameProperty values are stored as key:value pairs; the filter expression must indicate the key and a string to search the data values for. For example, to search for game sessions with custom data containing the key:value pair "gameMode:brawl", specify the following: gameSessionProperties.gameMode = "brawl". All custom data values are searched as strings.    maximumSessions -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with CreateGameSession or updating with UpdateGameSession.    creationTimeMillis -- Value indicating when a game session was created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.    playerSessionCount -- Number of players currently connected to a game session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session or drop out.    hasAvailablePlayerSessions -- Boolean value indicating whether a game session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can join.     Returned values for playerSessionCount and hasAvailablePlayerSessions change quickly as players join sessions and others drop out. Results should be considered a snapshot in time. Be sure to refresh search results often, and handle sessions that fill up before a player can join.

When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources on the queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times out. A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each player included in the request. When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed in preference order. Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency data for each player in relevant regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game play across all players.  To place a new game session request, specify the following:   The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings   A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to track the status of the placement request   (Optional) A set of IDs and player data for each player you want to join to the new game session   Latency data for all players (if you want to optimize game play for the players)   If successful, a new game session placement is created.

    ///  Finds new players to fill open slots in an existing game session.

By backfilling with the same matchmaker used to create the original match, you ensure that new players meet the match criteria and maintain a consistent experience throughout the game session. You can backfill a match anytime after a game session has been created.  To request a match backfill, specify a unique ticket ID, the existing game session's ARN, a matchmaking configuration, and a set of data that describes all current players in the game session. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. The ticket is placed in the matchmaker's ticket pool and processed. Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed. For more detail how to set up backfilling, see  Backfill Existing Games with FlexMatch.  The process of finding backfill matches is essentially identical to the initial matchmaking process. The matchmaker searches the pool and groups tickets together to form potential matches, allowing only one backfill ticket per potential match. Once the a match is formed, the matchmaker creates player sessions for the new players. All tickets in the match are updated with the game session's connection information, and the GameSession object is updated to include matchmaker data on the new players.

    ///  Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules, and starts a new game for the matched players. Each matchmaking request specifies the type of match to build (team configuration, rules for an acceptable match, etc.). The request also specifies the players to find a match for and where to host the new game session for optimal performance. A matchmaking request might start with a single player or a group of players who want to play together. FlexMatch finds additional players as needed to fill the match. Match type, rules, and the queue used to place a new game session are defined in a MatchmakingConfiguration. For complete information on setting up and using FlexMatch, see the topic  Adding FlexMatch to Your Game. To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also include a set of player attributes relevant for the matchmaking configuration. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully completed matches.  Tracking ticket status -- A couple of options are available for tracking the status of matchmaking requests:    Polling -- Call DescribeMatchmaking. This operation returns the full ticket object, including current status and (for completed tickets) game session connection info. We recommend polling no more than once every 10 seconds.   Notifications -- Get event notifications for changes in ticket status using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). Notifications are easy to set up (see CreateMatchmakingConfiguration) and typically deliver match status changes faster and more efficiently than polling. We recommend that you use polling to back up to notifications (since delivery is not guaranteed) and call DescribeMatchmaking only when notifications are not received within 30 seconds.    Processing a matchmaking request -- FlexMatch handles a matchmaking request as follows:    Your client code submits a StartMatchmaking request for one or more players and tracks the status of the request ticket.    FlexMatch uses this ticket and others in process to build an acceptable match. When a potential match is identified, all tickets in the proposed match are advanced to the next status.    If the match requires player acceptance (set in the matchmaking configuration), the tickets move into status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE. This status triggers your client code to solicit acceptance from all players in every ticket involved in the match, and then call AcceptMatch for each player. If any player rejects or fails to accept the match before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped (see AcceptMatch for more details).   Once a match is proposed and accepted, the matchmaking tickets move into status PLACING. FlexMatch locates resources for a new game session using the game session queue (set in the matchmaking configuration) and creates the game session based on the match data.    When the match is successfully placed, the matchmaking tickets move into COMPLETED status. Connection information (including game session endpoint and player session) is added to the matchmaking tickets. Matched players can use the connection information to join the game.
